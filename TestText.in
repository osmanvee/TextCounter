You must not submit or look at solutions to the assignment problems that are not your own. Submitting a solution you found on the Internet or obtained from another student, past or present, in part or in whole, is an obvious violation of this rule. Moreover, looking at solution from someone else to determine how to solve the problem can also lead to a plagiarism violation. The best way to stay on the safe side is to not search for solutions to the specific assignment problems in this course.

You must not share your solution code with other students, nor ask others to share their solutions with you. It may seem a little strange, but you may be penalized just as heavily for academic misconduct by simply giving away your assignment code to another student, as it may be considered as aiding to commit plagiarism. You may discuss your problem solving strategies with other students, but be careful not to do this to the extent that you end up submitting essentially the same program code.

You must indicate on your submission any assistance received. If you received aid from someone other than a TA or course instructor when completing your assignment, you must indicate the source and extent of the aid. A citation should include the source and a clear description of how this influenced your work.
